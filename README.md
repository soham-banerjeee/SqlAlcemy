# SqlAlchemy

For this homework, you need to create a new branch of your calculator project or you can make a new project. 
In this branch, you need to follow this tutorial: https://overiq.com/sqlalchemy-101/crud-using-sqlalchemy-orm/

This tutorial required me to follow previous hands on tutorials to get sqlAlchemy to work with sqlite instead 
of the Postgres connection used with the project.
